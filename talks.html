        <p>Functional programming is everywhere, and while there may be debate over whether JavaScript could be considered a functional language, it does have one big thing going for it: first-class functions. Functions allow for a great deal of flexibility in our code, but coding in a more functional style requires a new way of approaching problems. In this talk, we'll go back to basics of what a function is math, in computer programming and in JavaScript specifically. We'll look
          at the power of composition to make larger programs out of little generic pieces. We'll look at higher-order functions and finally combinators that allow use to augment our functions with new behavior to create new functions.</p>

        <p>Imperative languages provide looping constructs such as for﻿ and while﻿ that allow us to iteratively perform tasks provided some predicate remains true. In functional languages, the use of looping constructs is highly discouraged; and in some the concept is completely absent. Instead, these languages favor recursion. Recursion gives us the same end result as a loop, but often the solution is much simpler. The benefit of recursion is that we can break our problem into simple cases and handle each appropriately without having to worry about the extra state that comes with a loop. The drawback is that we need to change how we approach the problem.</p>
