# Things New Devs Ask: How To Refactor Legacy Code         
>Wherein I swallow my pride and ask total n00b questions and expect you to answer them.

## A Little Background

 I only know one software development process. I've been with the same company my entire career, so the way I know is their way. But I know that other ways exist; I just don't know anything about them. The way I know is what I, a know-nothing newbie, would describe as waterfall. For most of my time in IT I was an analyst, and I moved to that position from "the business." The process we used was the only one I knew, and it was the only one I knew existed. When I started to get interested in development, I started reading more and I read about Agile and XP, but never thought much of it. I moved to development with my company two months ago and all of those things that made sense because, "that's just how we do it," started to make less sense. So that brings me to my question.

## The Question

### _Do other organizations have the concept of a Code Freeze?_

Everything we do is planned way in advance. We will have release every 6 weeks. Requirements will be given to devs X number of weeks prior to release. Devs get X number of weeks to complete before any build makes it to our "Integration" environment. That date is the Code Freeze date for that release. The last possible date, in theory, that code can be written for that release. Of course, it never happens that way. The date is supposedly set in stone. What bug fixes or features get implemented are based solely on whether or not they can make that date. The date doesn't move, you do.

The whole idea seems nuts to me as a dev, though it made total sense as an analyst for some reason. I'm curious how it works in more agile environments. Does it even exist? You've got to have some way of saying, "This is all that is going with this release/sprint/whatever," don't you? I mean, aside from a continuous delivery situation, like GitHub or something, you have to have this...right?
