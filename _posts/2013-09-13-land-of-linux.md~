# Lost in the Land of Linux

A while back, influenced by my declining opinion of Windows 8, my increased desire to learn new languages, and my inability to afford a Mac, I decided to make the switch to Linux. I started with 30 day trial with Ubuntu 12.10 installed side-by-side with Windows but with the caveat that I would not boot into Windows. I usually like to emerse myself in things when learning something new, and that was my goal here. I could have just gone back to Windows 7, but that wasn't the point. For what I wanted to do, Windows provided just enough friction to be a catalyst. Plus, you should try completely new things every so often; throw away everything you know and try something hard.

If I went a month before backing up my files, paving my SSD and installing Ubuntu as my only OS, I would be surprised.

# I'm Sold

I was sold on Linux. Honestly, I knew very little about the inner workings of Windows, and I know even less about Linux, so being sold on it was not because I knew it to be technically superior. No, it was much simpler than that. Linux opened my eyes to a whole new way of working. No Visual Studio, no .NET, just text editor and a package manager. Run a couple of commands in the terminal and go. Sure, I could have done similar stuff in Windows, but that's not the .NET way. Programming in .NET is largely perscribed to you. There are great projects out there with a larger world view, but, for the most part, if you in .NET you're probably doing it the Microsoft way.

Aside from the development stuff, Linux gave me choice. Don't like this Unity? Get KDE, or XFCE, or Gnome, or whatever. It was sort of mind blowing, as embarassing as that is to say.

# Adrift in a Sea of Choice

Once I realized that I had such a glut of choices in front of me, I started to wonder what I was thinking when I signed on for the first one I found. I went with Ubuntu originally because what the hell other distro did I know about? But now I knew there was more out there, and I knew how easy they were to get and try and install. So I did.

I started with CrunchBang for no other reason than I saw it mentioned in a tweet by Steve Klabnik. That's it. It was serentipidous, really. I freaking loved CrunchBang. Fast as anything, light-weight and uses almost no resources. Most importantly, it wasn't like anything I had ever used before. Ubuntu was very much like I was used to, and I found myself using crutches instead of trying hard stuff. CrunchBang was going to be hard, so I ran with it.
