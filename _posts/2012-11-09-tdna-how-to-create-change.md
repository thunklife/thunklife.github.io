# Things New Devs Ask: How To Create Change         
>Wherein I swallow my pride and ask total n00b questions and expect you to answer them.

## A Little Background

 I find it hard to believe that team dynamics in most organizations differ greatly from ours. Chances are you've got that one dev that is the goto (see what I did there?) for any decisions for a given codebase. If you have a structure in your team where one dev works on UI, one works on services and one works on data stuff, chances are this dev works on the "backend" stuff. They have "Senior" and probably "III" in their title...or "Architect". For the most part, this is the opinion that matters (according to the rest of the team). You? You're new. You don't know the app like this dev does. You haven't been there for all of the bugs and requirements that have lead them to this conclusion, so you should probably just STFU.

But...

But you know there are better ways to do this. You've got suggestions. You've got ideas. You have a vision for how much better things could be. 

## The Question

### _How do you become an instrument of change in your organization?_

That wording makes me shudder, but I couldn't come up with anything that got my point across and didn't make me sound like an 8th grader stumbling through an oral report (as it stands I sound like an 8th grader using some "smart-sounding" words he just discovered). The point is this: as a new, inexperienced, and ,likely, mostly unrespected developer, how do you get your voice heard? How do you say, "Look, what we're doing is making things much more difficult for us. We need to stop and do [insert idea here] instead."  How do you do begin to change the way people have always done things? Is it even worth trying? How do you do it without coming off arrogant and self-righteous? Where do you start?
