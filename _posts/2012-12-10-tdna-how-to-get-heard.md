# Things New Devs Ask: How To Get Heard          
>Wherein I swallow my pride and ask total n00b questions and expect you to answer them.

## A Little Background

I tend to be a timid person, especially since I consider myself to be a fraud. I'm fairly new to development, very new to professional development and so I naturally question my opinions when faced with the more seasoned views of my seniors. I try to approach things in a way to optimize learning from my peers. Plus I constantly question myself.

However, there comes a time when the choices of others come around to bite you, and your decision to stay silent and conform has only made things worse for you. Eventually, you hit the wall and you have to stop and say "Look, we're having to hack around our own design. We need to stop, take a step back and admit that what we've done is wrong and fix it." And you feel good about yourself. You decided to put yourself out there and you feel safe because you did it at a time of mutual pain.

"Everybody is going to agree with this because everybody is going to realize what a pain in the ass this is right now. High-five, me!" And you high-five yourself...but only mentally.

But then they don't. Maybe they disagree, maybe, as was my case, they just move on and continue the hackery.

## The Question

### _What do you do, when you aren't being heard?_

Keeping in mind my generally timid nature as a result of terrible self-confidence, what do you do when you just arent' being heard? When, for whatever reason, members of your team are so invested in how they've been doing things that they just don't want to hear another way to do it. I guess this goes back to another question I asked, but, well, I finally got up the guts to say what I thought and all I heard was *THUD*. So what then?
