          this also included some C# work using Microsoft's ASP.NET Web API framework. The backend was designed to be hypermedia enabled ReSTful service which adhered

        <p>Developer responsible for maintenance of legacy applications primarily used by internal customers (insurance agents, etc.). The technology stack was wide-ranging, though
          all Microsoft technology. It included ASP.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation, and MS SQL. I had a hand in maintaining all parts of the applications our team
          was responsible for, from the front-end (whether it be HTML/JS/CSS or Windows controls) all the way down to the database (including SPROCs). Toward the end of my tenure with this team
          I was tasked with creating a new web application which I designed and implemented using ASP.NET MVC on the backend and KnockoutJS on the frontend. The application allowed users to
        reconcile client records through by providing a diff of the data and allowing the user to pick with data elements were correct.</p>

        <p>Engineer/Developer on a team responsible for the company's intranet built on top of Microsoft SharePoint. My duties included customizing SharePoint pages with CSS and JS, 
          creating custom lists and workflows, SharePoint administration, and custom C# app development (primarily to automate tasks). I'm most proud of a tool I created using an OSS library
          that indexed all of the sites in our farm, compiled metadata about the each site, and dynamically displayed the data for each site a user visited; allowing them to see when it was
          updated, which organization owned the site, and the users responsible for content. I'm especially proud of my work to get the running time of the job from 9 hours to 15 minutes;
          unfortunately I wasn't allowed to share my improvements with the creators of the library we used.</p>
        <p>I also had an opportunity to build an internal DSL for configuring a workflow that converted documents from one format to another (can't recall which). It was a good yak shave
          and proved to be a very extensible solution</p>

        <p>Business/Application Analyst and occasional desinger on a team building and maintaining a large automobile insurance application. I was responsible for rather requirements,
          defining business rules for the backend, "view specifications" for the frontend, creation of functional and regression test plans as well as execution of those plans. I was also
          responsible for leading meetings, and worked closely with developers to ensure requirements were met.</p>
        <p>At some point I became somewhat skilled in Photoshop (though I've lost what skills I had) and found myself designing various cross-promotion ads for the site and having a role
          in a site-wide redesign.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a self-taught developer living and working in San Diego, California. For most of my life I had no idea what I wanted to do. Actually I thought I would make movies, but all I ever
      ended up doing was skating all the time and ignoring school. I lucked into a job with good pay and benefits when I was 19 (March 2000). The company was extremely large and had more than
      enough places that I could bounce around to so as not to get bored. In 2007 I found what I thought would be my career, until I decided to challenge myself to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>After that there was no doubt that I wanted to be a programmer.</p>
    <p>I spent the next couple of years learning one thing, convicing myself that was all I was smart enough to do and then surprising myself by learning something harder. I taught myself HTML and CSS
      then PHP, C# and then I really dove into JavaScript. I found its flexibility, simple data structures and first-class functions to be very appealing.</p>
    <p>In late 2013, I decided to jump into the deepend and learn Haskell. I was looking for something new that would put me as far out of my comfort zone as possible.
      Haskell did just the trick. I'm completely addicted to the ideas of functional programming.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about learning, and I'm always looking for a new challenge.</p>
