        <p>Developer responsible for maintenance of legacy applications primarily used by internal customers (insurance agents, etc.). The technology stack was wide-ranging, though
          all Microsoft technology. It included ASP.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation, and MS SQL. I had a hand in maintaining all parts of the applications our team
          was responsible for, from the front-end (whether it be HTML/JS/CSS or Windows controls) all the way down to the database (including SPROCs). Toward the end of my tenure with this team
          I was tasked with creating a new web application which I designed and implemented using ASP.NET MVC on the backend and KnockoutJS on the frontend. The application allowed users to
        reconcile client records through by providing a diff of the data and allowing the user to pick with data elements were correct.</p>
