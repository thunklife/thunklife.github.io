  <p><em>This is the first post in a series about building a browser application using node, npm and browserify…and that’s it. The current version of the code can be found on <a href="http://github.com/wilhelmson/flickr-viewer">GitHub</a></em></p>
<h2 id="to-framework-or-not-to-framework">To Framework or Not To Framework</h2>
<p>The internetz are always full with posts and conversations about the latest and greatest frameworks. Everywhere I turn there is another “Why Framework X is better than Framework Y” thread. Recently, however, the idea of building things without <a href="http://blog.getify.com/silly-rabbit-frameworks-are-for-prototypes/">frameworks</a> has been <a href="http://codeofrob.com/entries/look-ma,-no-frameworks.html">coming up</a>. And the <a href="http://dontkry.com/posts/code/using-npm-on-the-client-side.html">idea</a> is pretty <a href="http://maxogden.com/node-packaged-modules.html">prevelant</a> in the node community.I don’t want to spend too much time on rehashing this, but I’ll touch on it briefly.</p>
<p>Frameworks are cool, I guess. I see their utility and I know plenty of people are building cool things with them. For me, the tradeoffs involved aren’t always worth it. Choosing a framework can be freeing in some aspects, but limiting in others. You’re forced into doing things the way the creators envisioned, but I guess if you share that vision, then you’ve made the right choice. Personally, I’m not to keen on being forced to write my code in a certain way because the framework says so. Consider, also, that a framework is designed to be all things to all people. Ultimate resuse. Ultimate generality. This makes them huge, non-modular pieces of code. Again, my preference (these days) is to use smaller, specialized modules and compose my application from there.</p>
<p>My ideas on how to build things aren’t new. They are, however, new to me. I’ve only recently started diving into node, and I’ve become a big fan of the small modules approach; the Unix Philosophy. That way of building things is completely new to me, so I took up this project as a way to step up my game. As I wrote the app, I really liked the way things shaped up, so I thought I would share my approach.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>My main goal was to use node and npm only. I wanted to use the node module pattern, and the vast library of modules in npm to build an application for the browser. What I didn’t want to do was build a back-end. This is merely a browser exercise. These are the constraints I set up for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write all code in node</li>
<li>ZERO FRAMEWORKS</li>
<li>Use npm for all things</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough of that. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>
<p>I’m going to assume you have node and npm installed, so the first thing you want to do is set up a directory, and a repo. <sub>~</sub> bash mkdir flickr-viewer &amp;&amp; cd flickr-viewer/ &amp;&amp; git init <sub>~</sub></p>
<p>Simple enough. Now we need a .gitignore. I keep mine simple. <sub>~</sub> bash echo node_modules &gt; .gitignore <sub>~</sub></p>
<p>The last thing we need to get things started is package.json. You might have your own, I was still new to all of this so I went with: <sub>~</sub> bash npm init <sub>~</sub> Then I just answered all of the prompts and moved on.</p>
<h2 id="builds">Builds</h2>
<p>My third goal was to use npm for everything, so it works out nicely that there is <code>npm run</code>. We can create commands in our <code>package.json</code> and run them with npm. No Make, Jake, Grunt or anything else. I don’t have any preference, yet, but I wanted to keep things simple, and npm had what I needed built in.</p>
<p>Before we can set up the build scripts, we’ll need to pull in a couple of modules. I’ll explain each in a moment.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">npm</span> install browserify --save-dev
<span class="kw">npm</span> install watchify --save-dev
<span class="kw">npm</span> install catw --save-dev
<span class="kw">npm</span> install uglify-js --save-dev
<span class="kw">npm</span> install http-server --save-dev
<span class="kw">npm</span> install hbsfy --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, each of those is going to install into your local node_modules, but you could just as easily choose to install them globally. I like this approach because anybody that wants to pull down your project just needs to run <code>npm install</code> and everything is ready for them.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/browserify">browserify</a>. Browserify is what lets us write node modules for the browser. It goes through your require calls and bundles up all the dependecies.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/watchify">watchify</a>. The README for this package says it all. It watches for changes in your source files, and re-bundles them with browserify.</p>
<p>The next one is a little strange, but it’ll make sense in a second. <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/catw">catw</a> concatenates files while watching for changes.</p>
<p>Next, we’ve got <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/uglify-js">uglify-js</a>, which is JS parser, minifier, compressor, etc. Basically, making your JS read for production.</p>
<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/http-server">http-sever</a> is a simple http server, and is honestly totally optional. If you prefer something else, then go for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, we’ve got <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/hbsfy">hbsfy</a>. I chose to use <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a> for templating and hbsfy will work with browserify to allow me to require my <code>.hbs</code> files like any other module.</p>
<p>Now for the good stuff, the builds. Now, I can’t take credit for this, they’re taken directly from <a href="http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run">an article</a> by <a href="https://npmjs.org/~substack">substack</a>. Here is the scripts section of package.json.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="st">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="op">{</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;build-js&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;browserify -t hbsfy app.js | uglifyjs -mc &gt; public/app.js&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;build-css&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;cat css/*.css &gt; public/css/site.css&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;build&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;npm run build-js &amp;&amp; npm run build-css&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;watch-js&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;watchify -t hbsfy app.js -o public/app.js&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;watch-css&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;catw css/*.css -o public/css/site.css&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;watch&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;npm run watch-js &amp;&amp; npm run watch-css&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>
    <span class="st">&quot;start&quot;</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;http-server&quot;</span>
  <span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I won’t go into the nitty-gritty of each, but essentially you’ve got two sets of commands.</p>
<p>First you’ve got your ‘watch’ commands: ‘watch-js’ and ‘watch-css’. ‘watch-js’ uses watchify to take everything in app.js, bundle it up, and watch it. Similarly, ‘watch-css’ will use catw to concatenate my CSS files and watch them. I’m not doing anything fancy with the CSS, so a simple concatenation works just fine. ‘watch’ is just a handy hand shortcut to run both.</p>
<p>Next you’ve got your ‘build’ commands: ‘build-js’ and ‘build-css’. They basically do the exact same thing as the ‘watch’ commands except they don’t watch, plus the bundled JS gets run through uglifyjs. Again, we’ve got a shortcut to both with ‘build’.</p>
<p>Lastly, you’ve got ‘start’. This just spins up http-server.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-up">Finishing Up</h2>
<p>OK. We’re all setup, so let’s make sure everything works. First we need our public directory.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">mkdir</span> public</code></pre></div>
<p>To make sure all of the pieces are playing nicely, we’ll add a simple app.js and index.hbs file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="co">//app.js</span>
<span class="kw">var</span> template <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">'./index.hbs'</span>)<span class="op">,</span>
	container <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">document</span>.<span class="at">getElementById</span>(<span class="st">'container'</span>)<span class="op">;</span>

<span class="va">container</span>.<span class="at">innerHTML</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">template</span>()<span class="op">;</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="co">&lt;!-- index.hbs --&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello from Handlebars!<span class="kw">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
Of course, we’ll need an entry point for our app. So we’ll add an index.html to the public directory. <sub>~</sub> html
<html>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</html>
<p><sub>~</sub></p>
<p>Next:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">npm</span> run watch</code></pre></div>
<p>If we did everything right, we should get something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">flickr-viewer@0.0.0</span> watch /home/wilhelmson/Projects/myApp
<span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">npm</span> run watch-js <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">npm</span> run watch-css


<span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">flickr-viewer@0.0.0</span> watch-js /home/wilhelmson/Projects/myApp
<span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">watchify</span> -t hbsfy app.js -o public/app.js</code></pre></div>
<p>Assuming everything worked, all that is left to do is: <sub>~</sub> bash npm run start <sub>~</sub></p>
<p>The http-server module will print the port number it is running on in the console, probably 8000, so just hit that and you should see: <img src="../images/flickr-viewer-intro.png" /></p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2>
<p>OK, so that might not seem to impressive, but set up rarely is. However, we’ve now got a nice platform to build our application from. We’ve got the main pieces in play to write, build an run our app, and it’s all built using only what node and npm have to offer.</p>
<p>In the next few posts I want to cover building each of the different pieces of the application. My focus on building this app was to keep things small and single-minded. As things progress, I touch on how I chose to do that.</p>
