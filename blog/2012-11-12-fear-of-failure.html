<article class="post-content">
  <p>Right now my 5 year old is obsessed with playing checkers. Aside from walking around the house singing songs in a random stream of conciousness, it’s her favorite thing to do. Now, my wife and I have very different takes on how to play checkers with a 5 year old. My wife takes what I would call the “standard mom approach,” also known as “letting the kid win.” Her main concern when playing the game is to have fun and build our daughter’s confidence.</p>
<p>Can you guess my approach?</p>
<p>I win. Almost every time. And you’re probably saying, “What?! C’mon, man, let the kid win,” but let me explain. First, it’s not like I utterly destroy her. I approach the game as an opportunity to teach my daughter two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We don’t always win, but that’s not why we play</li>
<li>Most importantly, we learn from our defeats</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t win because I don’t like losing, or because I’m a jerk. I win because I’m teaching my daughter how to think about the game (yes, I know it’s only checkers). I want her to learn how to play, how to think critically, how to consider the options before her. I want her to know that we learn by failing first, and trying again. And it works! It worked so well that the last time my wife and daughter played, my wife had to actually <em>try to win</em>. My 5 year old was thinking moves ahead, considering each option, each outcome, trying to predict where mom was going next. It was awesome. ## Do As I Say, Not As I Do</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, I know that the relationship between failure and deep understanding exists absolutely. I’m a self-taught developer. Up to this point, I’ve only learned by failing (and a few community college courses, sure). Yet I’ve come to realize something about myself: I’m afraid of taking that first step and failing. I’m not sure why exactly, but I have an idea.</p>
<p>Being self-taught, and being in my first professional developer role with the only company I’ve worked for in my entire adult life has me constantly questioning myself. As far as I’m concerned, I’m a phony. Sure, I know a thing or two, and I can bang out some code, but I’m truly afraid of trying something difficult for fear of proving that I really have no idea what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Jeremy Miller had recently wrote a <a href="http://jeremydmiller.com/2012/11/10/my-comments-about-20-controversial-programming-opinions">post</a> where he gave some opinions on <a href="http://programmers.blogoverflow.com/2012/08/20-controversial-programming-opinions/">some other people’s opinions</a>. In Jeremy’s post he seems to come back to the idea that it’s the truly hard problems that build a great developer. He suggests that working on side projects provides significanly more exposure to deep problem solving, which builds better developers. He also suggests that a developer who spends time on complex problems in a single language is probably spending their time more wisely than one who makes numerous TODO apps in a variety of languages.</p>
<p>Both of these points I totally agree with, and they made me realize something about myself. You see, hard problems are, well, hard. You have to learn hard, often big-brainy-type things. You fail. A lot. But, the payoff is immense. The knowledge you gain from working on complex problems cannot be oversold. I know that, really I do. But with each more difficult problem, the probability of realizing that I’m a complete phony is increased.</p>
<p>So I avoid the hard problems. I avoid the things that look too difficult for my phony little brain to grasp. I write little TODO apps because they’re easy, but hey, at least I built something, right? I have dreams of contributing to awesome OSS projects that I really like (looking at you <a href="https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc">Fubu</a>), but I kill them by telling myself, “You’re not on that level. You’re going to get outted for sure.”</p>
<p>I tell my daughter she can learn anything, and convince myself that I better not try because I might fail.</p>
<p>Damn. That’s depressing.</p>
<h2 id="but-i-know-better">But I Know Better</h2>
<p>The thing is, I know better. I really really do. Everything I know now seemed impossible before my kids were born (that’s when I started getting serious, as one does). I didn’t know the first thing about programming. I wanted to make a web page, but HTML and CSS seemed hard. But I learned it. I decided that was the most I could understand. JavaScript? Pffft, no way! But I learned it. Then I decided that was the most I could understand. Server-side stuff? Not a chance; that’s, like, real programming. But I learned PHP (insert obligatory PHP joke here). Then I decided that OO was out of my league. But I learned C#.</p>
<p>Over and over again I’ve told myself I couldn’t learn “it,” whatever that may be at the time. Over and over again I proved myself wrong. I know the cycle works. I know it so well that I force it down my kid’s throat: try something new, fail, learn.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the only thing that is going to prevent me, or anybody else, from improving is that fear. That fear will keep you where you feel safe, which is nice. It’s warm there. Familiar. But it’s not where you want to be. If it was, you wouldn’t want to change. You wouldn’t be looking to improve, to learn.</p>
<p>So I’m stuck between the desire to improve myself, and the fear that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N2zO8I8ob4">this is as good as it gets</a>. I’m sure I’ll get over it. Historically, I always have. The trick is learning what the catalyst is. What is that thing that allows you to put your fear of failure behind you, and push on no matter what the outcome, because the payoff is too good let fear hold you back.</p>
