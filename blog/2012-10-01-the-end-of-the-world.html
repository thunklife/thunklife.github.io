<article class="post-content">
  <p>Not too long ago something terrible happened. I’m not sure exactly what caused it, but I have my theories. Maybe a tiny meteor managed to make it through our atmosphere, and hit land at just the right spot. Maybe it was a that group of ex-KGB agents I had a run-in with; they have a very particular set of skills. Maybe it a server upgrade. Maybe it was ninjas. Probably it was ninjas.</p>
<p>Nobody knows for sure, but whatever it was (it was ninjas!), this site was down. For weeks. I kind of decided to just let it go until I had the time and energy to go through the process of bringing it back online. I don’t get a lot of readers, and I don’t post that often so no biggie, right? When the time finally came, I just assumed it would be fairly simple; how much damage could be done, after all? Enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-resurrection">The Resurrection</h2>
<p>I decided to start the process yesterday. Honestly, I wasn’t sure where to begin beyond the database. So step 1: back that bad-boy up!. My host has a simple 1 click method to backup your DB and download the .bak locally. They also have a simple restore process (maybe they all do, I don’t know), so I figured I was golden.</p>
<p>With backup in hand I began the process of upgrading the site. I made my first mistake right away: I tried to do this from a computer with a metric ton of restrictions on internet use (shhh… don’t tell my employer). The orchard in-place upgrade is actually pretty simple. Delete everything in /bin, delete stuff from App_Data, get newest version locally, move it to your server. TA-DAH!</p>
<p>Right. Well, my restrictions completely prohibited that. On to plan B: full-on reinstall of Orchard via the Web Apps gallery from my host. No big deal if I lose my settings or theme. I wrote the theme; packaging and install is “mad simple, yo.” Plus, I have have my DB backed up so I can install Orchard, restore the DB and VOILA!</p>
<p>Wrong again. The only thing that went as planned was the vanilla install of Orchard.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Turns out I don’t actually have my theme packaged up. That’s OK, because I can just package it up, right? Well, yeah, sure if I have Orchard installed locally. Now, when I say installed, I mean <strong>INSTALLED</strong>, not downloaded and unzipped. Orchard.exe has a packaging command, but it’s dependent on the packaging module which only exists if you’ve got a running instance of Orchard. Once that was done, packaging and installing the theme was also “mad simple, yo!”</p>
<p>Honestly, problem 1 was easy to fix. It was just an unexpected pain, but we learn from pain.</p>
<p>OK, quick status check:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>DB backed up</li>
<li>Orchard installed</li>
<li>Theme packaged</li>
<li>Theme installed</li>
<li>Time to restore that DB, son!</li>
</ol>
<p>The restore function provided by my host worked as you would expect and I had my DB.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Ruh-roh! My site no longer works? Yep. Something was rotten in the state of Denmark and it clearly had to do with the DB (right?) I should have known when I looked at the size of the DB after I restored. It was significantly smaller that the pre-restore DB. Still, I couldn’t let the idea that I had lost my data seap into my head, so I set off to restore it locally. I won’t bore you with the details of the string of calamities that occurred next. Suffice to say I don’t have my data.</p>
<h2 id="a-clean-slate">A Clean Slate</h2>
<p>Frustrating, don’t you think? Luckily, as I said before, I don’t post much. We’re not talking about huge amounts of data going lost, but still, I had people actually reading my posts! That really sucks. Don’t think I’m giving up though. One way or another, I’m getting my posts back. I don’t care if I have to copy them from Google’s cached version of my pages. I’m going to get them back, and I’m going to finish up my series on Composable View Models (really!).</p>
<p>And the next time those ninjas come around, I’ll be ready. I’ve been practicing. I have serious nunchuck skills.</p>
