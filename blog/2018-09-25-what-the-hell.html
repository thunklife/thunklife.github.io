  <p>I’ve been back online for a while now, but I was gone even longer. Most people know the gist, and some people know more; I try to be open about everything that went down. Either way, I felt like I should say something.</p>

<li><strong>Short Answer</strong> - I got sick.</li>
<li><strong>Short, But Depressing Answer</strong> - I got brain cancer.</li>

<h2 id="headaches">Headaches</h2>
<p>In May(ish) of 2017, I started getting these headaches. Really intense ones. I assumed they were related to stress, at the worst I had migraines. So I took Tylenol or Advil, and I went on with my life. Things got worse so I took more pills.</p>
<p>I took <em>a lot</em> of pills.</p>
<p>The headaches got worse and eventually got so bad that I woke up screaming. The pain would lessen so I would pop more pills and ignore it. Things got worse. I don’t really know to describe it, I simply felt like I wasn’t there. I had to sit down, chill for about an hour and drink water until it subsided. I tried to ignore that too.</p>
<p>I went to a neurologist. They did a CAT scan and some other tests (balance, walking, strength) and everything was normal; they figured what I did: I suffered from migraines.</p>
<p>Around the end of August, things got really bad. I ended up in the ER twice, but the shit didn’t hit the fan until the middle of October.</p>
<h2 id="the-hole">The Hole</h2>
<p>To be honest I don’t remember the details. There were MRIs involved, I had a seizure in front of the neurosurgeon as he was asking what was going on, and I ended up with a hole in my head.</p>
<p>See, the headaches and all the rest, were the result of spinal fluid building up because of swelling I had in my cerebellum. Normally, that stuff just drains, and your body takes care of it, but not me. Apparently, the ventricles that do the draining where huge so I blacked out and the neurosurgeon had to put a hole in my head to relieve the pressure.</p>
<p>The hole was put in with a hand-drill in my room. Or so I was told. I don’t remember anything, except afterward I swore that there was no way I had a hole in my head because I would remember that. I definitely had a hole in my head.</p>
<p>So, I had a hole in my head that was draining extra spinal fluid to a bag on my side of my bed. And every time I changed positions or the bed was moved the nurse has to come in and balance the drain…manually…with a balance you would pick up at your local hardware store. That was the state of the art. It wasn’t like I was unique, they had done this on tons of people and this is how it was done.</p>
<h2 id="surgery">Surgery</h2>
<p>Now that the pressure was relieved, it was time to figure out what was causing the swelling, which meant a biopsy or a biopsy + debulking; in the latter, the surgeon would try to safely remove as much of the tumor as they could. I chose the latter, and we waited for a few days for an OR to become available. The surgeon gave me a rundown of possible side effects, and things that might go wrong, the biggest concern for me was losing coordination and fine motor skills. I knew what could happen, but it’s still weird to go into surgery being able to write or type with your right hand, and then wake up and you can’t anymore. I can type now, but I lost a ton of speed and accuracy. We won’t talk about writing.</p>
<p>Since I still had that hole in my head I had to undergo a second surgery so it could be a permanent drain. Now I have this gnarly bump on my head and a tube that runs from there to my stomach where the excess fluid goes. If you see me wearing a hat, that’s probably why.</p>
<p>With all of that taken care of, the next step was to get the results of the biopsy. The neurosurgeon was pretty sure the tumor was benign because the alternative is extremely rare in adults. So off the sample went, and I went to another hospital for rehab.</p>
<h2 id="acute-rehab">Acute Rehab</h2>
<p>My wife and I decided I should do a week of Acute Rehab so the professionals could assess my different abilities. Could I walk, could I go to the bathroom or shower on my own, that kind of thing? All in all, it was good, except for the part where I had to have nightly injections of something and the nurse had to inject me in the stomach. A week went by, a ton of people came by and said hi, and then I got to go home.</p>
<h2 id="the-biopsy">The Biopsy</h2>
<p>It was over a month since the surgery (I ended up having to stay in the hospital for a few weeks), and the biopsy still hadn’t come back yet. I don’t remember how much time passed but I know we went through Thanksgiving and maybe even Christmas before we heard anything.</p>
<p>Turns out nobody knew what I had, so the sample kept getting kicked. Eventually, it landed at the Mayo Clinic. It took some time, but they figured out what was going on. SPOILER ALERT: The tumor wasn’t benign.</p>
<h2 id="medulloblastoma">Medulloblastoma</h2>
<p>About two months had gone by since the initial surgery and we finally got a diagnosis from the oncologist: Medulloblastoma. An “aggressive” cancer that attacks the brain and spreads by way of the spinal column. It is extremely rare in adults, usually affecting young kids, which is why it took so long to figure out what I had.</p>
<p>Neither my wife nor I had any idea what to do, and my oncologist had no idea either. We did a lot of crying. I thought I was done. I’m married. We have 3 young kids. I go to work all day while she homeschools. What the fuck were we going to do?</p>
<p>My oncologist said we were going to fight. They sent me for an MRI to see if the cancer had spread to my spine and gave me a referral to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) to see a radiation oncologist. That’s when we started getting so good news.</p>
<p>About a week later I did the MRI; 2 hours in a tube, but the cancer hadn’t spread. My oncologist did a spinal tap as well, and it was clean. I still had brain cancer but things were looking up. Then it turns out that the referral to UCSD landed me with one of the top doctors for medulloblastoma. They knew exactly what to do and explained the plan to my oncologist: two months of radiation followed by four months of chemotherapy. I remember the UCSD oncologist saying, “This isn’t going to be fun, but it won’t be the worst thing that has ever happened to you.” I don’t think I’ll ever forget that…unfortunately they were wrong.</p>
<h2 id="radiation">Radiation</h2>
<p>The next two months were pretty grueling. Before I actually started treatment I got measured so that each time I came in the therapists knew the right position to put me in. So I had to come in, lay down and get a bunch of marks put on me. Some were stickers, some are more permanent, they called them tattoos; now I have 4 permanent green marks, 2 on each side of my body. The best (worst) part was the mask. See, I couldn’t move my head at all during the treatments so they made a mask from my face. Each time I came for treatment they put the mask on. I’ll save you my horrible description and just point you to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=radiation+face+mask&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj15qT269ndAhV9JDQIHV5rDvsQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=741">Google</a>.</p>
<p>So every weekday, for two months, I drove 30 minutes to lay down, get adjusted until I was in the right position, and get radiation shot at me…for an hour. I say “I drove,” but I didn’t. Either my wife or mom or dad or father-in-law took me because I couldn’t drive; I had a car with a manual transmission. One time, for a week, I got transported by ambulance because I landed back in the hospital for some reason. Honestly, they all blend together now.</p>
<p>The radiation wasn’t painful, but it messed me up pretty good. I can’t remember if the fatigue or the nausea set in first, but I got both. The fatigue was easy enough to deal with, I just slept more and didn’t do much. The nausea was worse. I would try to keep food down and succeeded about half of the time. As a result, I lost a ton of weight. The radiation oncologist actually told me to eat burgers and drink milkshakes, anything to gain weight. I tried, but mostly I threw it up.</p>
<p>After the radiation came two weeks of rest and then four months of chemotherapy.</p>
<h2 id="chemotherapy">Chemotherapy</h2>
<p>I say “four months” but really the plan was four rounds. Each round is a month, but really it was a couple days hooked up to an IV bag with about a month in between.</p>
<p>I started chemotherapy off with a bang. I went into the Chemo Lounge for one reason or another, before the treatment actually started, and ended up throwing up all over myself. The nurses that were around helped my wife change me from my clothes to a hospital gown and I got to drive home in that. That was super fun.</p>
<p>Each treatment is a multi-day event. I would go in, get hooked up, and then sit in a chair for 4-5 hours, then I’d go home. Repeat that for a few days, and then take a month off. The whole thing was actually OK. I got a PICC line, basically a tube in my vein with a little port that the could connect to, so they didn’t have to give a proper stabbing each time I came in. It meant more maintenance, my wife had to flush it nightly and every week I had to go in to have the dressing changed. To me, it was better than the alternative;a thing called a Port which was the same idea but lasted twice as long and didn’t require the maintenance. It actually sounds great, so we consulted a surgeon and they made it sound like I was going to die in the OR so I said, “No thanks”.</p>
<p>The chemo didn’t cause me any fatigue or nausea it just killed my blood; white and red cells. That was enough to bring on the fatigue. It also brought a slew of blood transfusions and some hospital stays.</p>
<p>A blood transfusion is a hell of a thing. Once they figure out what type you are, they run a “cross” which I still don’t quite get; the best I got was that they were checking the blood banks to see if they had any of the blood I needed. I don’t know. They call up however many units you need, based on your blood counts, and hook you up. Each unit takes 2 hours. Twice I had to get 4 units which meant an overnight hospital stay. All together I probably had 4 or 5 transfusions, basically one for each treatment. Once, when I was feeling pretty good, I called my team at work and decided I would participate in our daily stand-up. I said something like, “I’m getting a blood transfusion, so I’ll be doing that all day. My only blocker is brain cancer.” They didn’t find it too funny but I thought it was hilarious.</p>
<h2 id="bringin-it-all-back-home">Bringin’ It All Back Home</h2>
<p><em>That’s a Bob Dylan reference, in case you missed it</em></p>
<p>After chemo and radiation, I was done. Sure, I have Physical and Occupational therapy, and the occasional MRI to check on my brain but as long as the cancer doesn’t come back I’m good. My energy levels are up, I don’t have fatigue and I keep food down. I started working from home in mid-July and go into the office on 10/01/2018 for the first time in almost a year. Should be fun.</p>
<p>I left out some details of the story but they’re not too important.</p>
<p>A lot of people helped in a lot of ways (rides, meals, money, babysitting, thoughts, prayers, etc.) and it was amazing. I don’t how we would have gone through all of this without all the help. If I never got a chance before, thank you for everything.</p>
<p>A special shout out to my employer for all of the support they’ve given me during all of this. They bent over backward to make sure they did everything they could for me and I am forever thankful.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just want to say a little about my wife. She took me to countless appointments, sat with me during chemo and blood transfusions, came to see me every day at the hospital, cooked meals, shopped, got me my meds, took care of the insurance, homeschooled our kids, took them to a bunch of day camps in the summer…I am for sure missing stuff. The point is, she is the most amazing person I know and I’m extremely lucky to have married her.</p>
<h2 id="le-fin">Le Fin</h2>
<p>If you’re starring down this barrel, I feel for you. I really do. It’s not fun, but you can get through it. You might get sick, you might land in the hospital, it might be the worst thing you’ve been through, but you can get through it. Do your best to stay positive, but also know that it’s ok to be negative sometimes, just don’t let that be your default state of being. You’re going to have to humble yourself, take help, be embarrassed (hell, I shit &amp; pissed myself while screaming &amp; crying for help at the hospital), that’s just the way it goes. Take all the help you can, be thankful for everything good in your life. Focus on that. You’re not going to be able to do that all of the time and that is OK. Know that you can beat this because you can.</p>
